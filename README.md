# Background:

In this assignment, I have created an interactive dashboard for exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset1. This dataset catalogs the diverse microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), that inhabit human navels.

Analysis of the dataset has revealed that a select few microbial species, present in more than 70% of individuals, dominate, while the majority of species are relatively rare.

I have implemented the dashboard using JavaScript and the D3.js library, showcasing visualizations such as a bar chart displaying the top OTUs, a bubble chart representing microbial abundance, and a gauge chart illustrating belly button washing frequency.
